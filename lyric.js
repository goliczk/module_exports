var lyrics = ['Caviar and cigarettes, Well versed in etiquette, Extraordinarily nice', 'I am a lost boy from Neverland, Usually hanging out with Peter Pan', 'So you can keep me, Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans, Holding me closer til our eyes meet, You wont ever be alone, wait for me to come home', 'I can see you there with the city lights, Fourteenth floor, pale blue eyes.', 'Im so confused, I must be losing it, this cant be right'];
